Title:
 - Lists and Dictionaries: The Hangman Game
Chapter Objectives:
 - To
   - Create, index, and slice a list
   - Add and delete elements from a list
   - Use list methods to append and sort a list
   - Use nested sequences to represent even more complex information
   - Use dictionaries to work with pairs of data
   - Add and delete dictionary items

***
Notes
***
 - Lists are sequences, like tuples
   - Lists are mutable - they can be modified
   - Everything you can do with tuples can also be done with lists
   - See hero_inventory3.py
     - Lists can also be concatenated, just like tuples
 - Understanding list mutability
   - See hero_inventory3.py again, for:
     - Assigning a new list element by index
     - Assigning a new list slice
     - Deleting a list element
     - Deleting a list slice
