Chapter 3 Exercises
===================

1. Write a program that simulates a fortune cookie. The program should display one of five unique fortunes, at random, each time it's run.

2. Write a program that flips a coin 100 times and then tells you the number of heads and tails.

(**Extended**: This is just experimentation: this version of the program allows the user to specify how many times they would like the coin to be flipped. The program then outputs the percentages of heads and tails at the end of the while loop.)

3. Modify the Guess My Number game so that the player has a limited number of guesses. If the player fails to guess in time, the program should display an appropriately chastising message.

4. Here's a bigger challenge. Write the psuedocode for a program where the player and the computer trade places in the number guessing game. That is, the player picks a random number between 1 and 100 that the computer has to guess. Before you start, think about how you guess. If all goes well, try coding the game.
