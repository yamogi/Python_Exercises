Title:
 - Branching, While Loops and Program Planning: The Guess My Number Game
Chapter Objectives:
 - To
   - Generate random numbers using randint() and randrange()
   - Use if statements to execute code based on a condition
   - Use an else clause to make a choice based on a condition
   - Use elif clauses to make a choice based on several conditions
   - Use while loops to repeat parts of your program
   - Plan your programs using psuedocode

Notes
***
 - To generate random integers:
     ...
     import random # important!
     ...
     die1 = random.randint(1,6)
     die2 = random.randrange(6) + 1
   - You generally call an imported function through the imported name
   - die1 will pick a random number between 1 and 6
   - die2 will pick a random number between 0 and 5, then add 1 to it
 - if statements allow you to branch your code
     if condition:
         do something
     ...
     if password == "correct password": # == is comparison
         print("Access Granted")
 - Other comparison operators:
     ==   equal to        (5 == 5)    True
     !=   not equal to    (8 != 5)    True
      >   greater than    (3 > 10)    False
      <   less than       (5 < 8)     True
     >=   greater than/
               equal to   (5 >= 10)   False
     <=   less than/
               equal to   (5 <= 5)    True
 - Use indentation to create blocks of code:
     if password == "correct password":
         print("Access Granted")
         print("Welcome! You must be someone very important.")
 - Use the else condition to do something if the condition evaluates to false:
     if password == "correct password":
         print("Access Granted")
     else:
         print("Access Denied")
 - Evaluate multiple possible outcomes of an if statement using elif
     if condition == 1:
         do thing 1
     elif condition == 2:
         do thing 2
     elif condition == 3:
         do thing 3
     else:
         default fail condition
 - Creating while loops
   - While [something] is true, repeat [action]
   - see while_loop.py
   - Be sure to update the sentry value!
       counter = 0
       while counter <= 10:
           print(counter)
           counter += 1 # updating the sentry value
 - Try and avoid infinite loops
 - ANY VALUE CAN BE TREATED AS TRUE/FALSE
   - see maitre_d.py
