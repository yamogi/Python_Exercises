Title:
 - For Loops, Strings, and Tuples: The Word Jumble Game
Chapter Objectives:
 - To
   - Construct for loops to move through a sequence
   - Use the range() function to create a sequence of numbers
   - Treat strings as sequences
   - Use tuples to harness the power of sequences
   - Use sequence functions and operators
   - Index and slice sequences

Notes
***
 - for loops repeat something based on a sequence
   - Simple example ->
       for letter in word:
           print(letter)
   - You can also count using a for loop ->
       for i in range(10):
           print(i, end=" ") # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
       OR
       for i in range(0, 50, 5):
           print(i, end=" ") # 0 5 10 15 20 [...] 40 45
       OR
       for i in range(10, 0, -1):
           print(i, end=" ") # 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
   - You do not have to use the loop variable
     - Example ->
         for i in range(10):
             print("Hi!") # prints "Hi!" 10 times
 - Strings are a simple type of sequence
 - It is easy to work out the length of a string
     message = input("Please enter a message: ")
     print("The length of your message is:", len(message))
 - Finding out if a character is inside another string
     if "e" in message:
         # do action 1
     else:
         # do action 2
 - Sequential access is accessing one index after the other, in order
   - You can also have "random access" which lets you access later elements without the need to access previous ones
     - See random_access.py
