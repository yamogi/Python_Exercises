Chapter 4 Exercises
===================

1. Write a program that counts for the user. Let the user enter the starting number, ending number, and the amount by which to count.

2. Create a program that gets a message from the user and then prints it out backwards.

3. Improve "Word Jumble" so that each word is paired with a hint. The player should be able to see the hint if he or she is stuck. Add a scoring system that rewards players who solve a jumble without asking for a hint. (**Extended**: In this experimental version of the exercise, instead of providing the first letter of the word as a hint, I instead implemented a second HINTS tuple, where each index corresponds to the relevant word. In order to achieve this, I needed to pick a random index using randrange to ensure that WORDS and HINTS were working off of the same index value.)

4. Create a game where the computer picks a random word and the player has to guess that word. the computer tells the player how many letters are in the word. Then the player gets five chances to ask if a letter is in the word. The computer can only respond with "yes" or "no". Then, the player must guess the word.
